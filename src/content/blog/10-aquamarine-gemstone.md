## Overview

The name aquamarine comes from _aqua_ (Latin for `water`), and _marine_, deriving from _marina_ (Latin for `of the sea`). The first reference in English to "Aquamarina" appears in **Anselmus Boetius De Boot** book _GEMMARUM ET LAPIDUM HISTORIA_ (1609, in Latin). It was later cited in _A Lapidary History or History of Precious Stones_ by **Thomas Nicols**, Cambridge (1652, page 114), where it states that the name was used by the Italians for blue-green varieties of beryl.
