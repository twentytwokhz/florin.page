> A beginning is a very delicate time

![img](../../assets/images/2021-10-15/01-first_post.jpg)

As good old [Frank Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert) would put it.

Delicate is, _indeed_, a good way of describing the intro to [Dune](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)>) (We'll get to explore this wonderful book in an upcoming post - lots of valuable lessons to learn from there)

...but it can also be applied to the beginning of my new blog 🏆

As told by the cover image..

> Everyday **is** a _fresh_ start

Today is a **fresh** start for me. Being in a writer's position is quite the challenge, but an opportunity as well. An oportunity to learn and a chance to _help_ other people improve their lives. For me that is a huge responsibility, but also something to be grateful about.

In my upcoming ventures and *ad*ventures you will find a varied cuisine of delicious topics:

- life hacks
- tech news
- personal development
- tutorials

So, in the hopes that you will find this content engaging & helpful...

## Enjoy! 😇
