## Overview

Named in 1832 by Francois Sulpice Beudant for the type locality, the Parys Mine on the Island of Anglesey (Ynys MÃ´n) in Wales, U.K.

Anglesite forms transparent colourless crystals, often with yellow, green or blue shades. Anglesite is cut into attractive faceted stones, but it is brittle and sensitive to heat.

Fine crystals are found at various places in the USA, in the Leadhills district, Scotland and the best cuttable material comes from the Touissit mine, Oujda, Morocco.
