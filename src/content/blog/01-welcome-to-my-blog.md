> A beginning is a very delicate time.

said <cite>Frank Herbert[^1]</cite>

![img](../../assets/images/2021-10-15/01-first_post.jpg)

Delicate is, _indeed_, a good way of describing the intro to <cite>Dune[^2]</cite> (We'll get to explore this wonderful book in an upcoming post - lots of valuable lessons to learn from there)

...but it can also be applied to the beginning of my new blog üèÜ

As told by the cover image..

> Everyday **is** a _fresh_ start

Today is a **fresh** start for me. Being in a writer's position is quite the challenge, but an opportunity as well. An oportunity to learn and a chance to _help_ other people improve their lives. For me that is a huge responsibility, but also something to be grateful about.

In my upcoming ventures and *ad*ventures you will find a varied cuisine of delicious topics:

- life hacks
- tech news
- personal development
- tutorials

So, in the hopes that you will find this content engaging & helpful...

## Enjoy! üòá
