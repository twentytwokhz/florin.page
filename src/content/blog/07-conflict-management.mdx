## Table of contents

When dealing with conflict we tend to forget **who** we are, and get drenched in negative feelings. We also tend to disregard the dialog with another human being, whose life we don't know nor understand.

Let's try to understand which personality traits you have and how to use them appropriately. Instead of relying on emotions let's rely on our core strengths.

## Which animal do you relate to? 🐻🐢🦉🦈🦊

There are various ways/styles to manage conflict dependant on your personality.

## 1. Accommodating 🐻

Cooperating to a high degree, sometimes at the expense of your own goals and objectives.

> I don't care that much.
> I give in!

### Pros

- Other party is the expert/has a better solution
- Maintaining relationships

### Cons

- May feel resentful for being unable to give their opinion or be heard

## 2. Avoiding 🐢

This style usually avoids the issues.

> I can't deal with this right now

### Pros

- Can be useful in dangerous situations
- Allows you to step back and cool down

### Cons

- Avoiding in situations that really matter to you
- Not a good long term solution

## 3. Collaborating 🦉

Pairs up to achieve goals of both parties, seeking **win-win**.

> Two heads are better than one

### Pros

- Reframing the challenge space for everybody's ideas

### Cons

- Requires high-degree of trust, time and effort from everyone involved

## 4. Competing 🦈

This is the **win-lose** approach.

> I take charge!

### Pros

- Assertive way to achieve goals
- Helpful when you need quick, decisive action

### Cons

- Not concerned about relationships
- May lead to losing friends

## 5. Compromising 🦊

This is the **lose-lose** approach. Neither party achieves what they want.

> Let's meet half way Let's split the difference

### Pros

- When temporary solution is needed
- Or both parties have equally important goals

### Cons

- Can be time consuming if both parties do not want to give something up
