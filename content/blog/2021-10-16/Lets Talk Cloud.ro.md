## What is the ‚òÅÔ∏è ?

There's this **mysterious** buzzword we keep hearing about - in the news, on the internet and in various conversations.
I will try my best to explain it in laymen terms.

## A Definition

The `cloud` can refer to distinct IT related topics based on it's suffix.
[Cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) generally refers to various IT infrastructure resources that are distributed across multiple regions and locations.
These resources are readily available for the end user without the need to understand the underlying "why" and "how".

## Providers

Cloud providers (also called Cloud service providers) are entities, usually large companies, in charge of provisioning and managing cloud resources for interested customers.

Their activities span five major areas including service deployment, service orchestration, cloud service management, security, and privacy.

## Cloud models

There are basically three models of cloud services that a provider offers:

1. Software as a Service ([SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service))
2. Platform as a Service ([PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service))
3. Infrastructure as a Service ([IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service))

Here is an overview of what each model offers:
